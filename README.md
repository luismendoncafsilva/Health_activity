# 🩺 Heart Disease & Lifestyle Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the relationship between heart disease and various lifestyle factors such as sleep, exercise, heart rate, and blood pressure, using a structured dataset containing anonymized health and behavioral metrics.

📊 Key Variables Explored:

- Hours of Sleep
- Exercise Hours per Week
- Heart Rate (bpm)
- Blood Pressure (systolic/diastolic)
- Heart Disease diagnosis (binary)

🧠 Objective:

To uncover whether there are notable lifestyle differences between individuals with and without heart disease, and to identify patterns that align with or contradict established clinical expectations.

✅ Key Insights:

Sleep & Exercise: Both groups (with and without heart disease) had nearly identical averages in sleep duration and weekly exercise hours. These lifestyle factors showed no meaningful difference.

Heart Rate: Surprisingly, individuals with heart disease had a slightly lower average heart rate than those without it. This result is counterintuitive and may reflect confounding variables such as medication use, age, or measurement inconsistencies.

Blood Pressure: Individuals with heart disease had higher average systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which aligns with established medical knowledge. This was the clearest differentiator between the two groups.
